As we gather around the glowing hearth of the **Gryffindor** common room, it is time to delve into the heart of our magical quest: the enchanted dataset. Imagine this dataset as a map of the wizarding world, filled with secrets and mysteries waiting to be uncovered. Each row is a character, each column a spell, and together they tell the story of our beloved Hogwarts."
